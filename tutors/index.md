excerpt: "Tutoring Referral Service by the PSA"
---

One of the services that the UFV PSA provides to the public is a tutor referral service for high school students who may be having difficulty with science or mathematics. This allows qualified tutors to become connected with students without the usual overhead associated with for-profit tutoring companies. We believe that this model works because:

* Students have greater flexibility with tutors regarding time slots and subject areas
* Tutors have a full support system behind them to advertise for new clients
* Students can build lasting relationships with tutors, who often can give advice about pathways after high school

If you're interested in connecting with the PSA either as a student or as a tutor, contact us via the form linked below.
