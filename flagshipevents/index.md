The Physics Student Association historically has organized two major socials events of the year: Casino Royale (also known as the Winter Formal) and the Big Bang.

Planned in co-operation with other student associations (the Biology and Chemistry Student Association, the Computing Student Association and others), these events have been focal points in the UFV calendar, providing mid-year and end of year celebrations for science students and non-science students alike.

While we are supported by the UFV Student Union Society, these events could not occur without the help of our community.
