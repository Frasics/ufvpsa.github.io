Joss Ives spent several years instructing UFV physics students, trying new teaching methods. He even won an award in 2013 for his efforts. He now works at UBC, researching the best methods of teaching physics. He will return on November 8 to share the results of his research and instruct students on the art of instructing. 

If you are considering going into teaching (or currently teach physics for a living), this talk will greatly help your career! Even if you aren’t planning to go into teaching (and many people do go into teaching even if they didn’t plan on it), learning to teach a topic like phyiscs will greatly improve your understanding of it.

Go to A353 from 3:00pm to 4:00pm to hear Joss's talk!

Oh, and there'll be free food!
