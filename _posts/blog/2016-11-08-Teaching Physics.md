Joss Ives spent several years instructing UFV physics students, trying new teaching methods. He even won an award in 2013 for his efforts. He now works at UBC, researching the best methods of teaching physics. He will return to UFV at 3pm on November 8 to share the results of his research and instruct students on the art of instructing.

Oh, and there'll be free food!
