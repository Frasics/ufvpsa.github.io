The UFV Physics Student Association is planning a trip to the Chilliwack Corn Maze! We believe this is a great opportunity to practice our real world problem solving skills and build community. We will be taking advantage of the on site fire pits for some s'mores after the mazes!

Contact <a href="vpsocial@ufvpsa.com">Jess Davies</a> for more information.
