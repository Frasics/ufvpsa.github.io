On Saturday, October 8 the PSA is planning a hike at Chadsey Lake! We will be meeting at the trailhead at 10am (carpooling is encouraged, but will not be organized by the PSA). The hike is not too difficult, so all levels of hikers are welcomed. Bring water and snacks, and feel free to bring friends along! See you there!
