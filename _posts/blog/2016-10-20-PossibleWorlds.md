>"Part science fiction, part murder mystery, and part love story, Possible Worlds opens with two detectives standing over the corpse of George Barber, whose scalp has been removed. Written by Governor Generalâ€™s Award winning playwright (and mathematician) John Mighton, this mind-bending play follows George and his lover Joyce through a baffling series of parallel worlds, as Detectives Berkley and Williams track a serial killer who appears to be stealing brains." - www.ufv.ca/plays

From October 20th to October 30th, the UFV Theatre department is performing "Possible Worlds", a play about the 'Many Worlds' interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. Tickets are $10.00 each. Check out <a href="www.ufv.ca/plays">UFV's Theatre Page</a> for more information.
