Dark matter presents a confounding mystery to modern physicists. We know that it exists, but don't know what it is. Dr. Terry Pilkington completed his undergrad at UFV before earning his PhD by researching dark matter, trying to shed some light on this dark secret. Go to Room A353 (UFV Abbotsford Campus) on September 28 from 5:30-6:30pm to learn more. 

Oh, and there'll be free food!
