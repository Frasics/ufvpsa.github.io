>The Sivak group uses theory and computation to study the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of molecular-scale biological processes. We seek to identify the physical constraints placed on biological systems by their operational imperatives: performing productive functions in finite time while driven by strong gradients, using fluctuation-dominated microscopic objects of low copy number in a cell at room temperature. Such constraints should point to the basic design principles of driven biomolecular-scale energy and information transmission, illuminate the (constrained) evolutionary optimization of molecular machines and cellular networks, and produce criteria for achieving particular functions in novel synthetic machines and networks. 

Dr. David Sivak has his Ph.D. in Biophysics and currently studies it at SFU. He's eager to share his progress to UFV's Physics, Chemistry, and Biology students. Go to B121 from 4:30pm to 5:30pm on October 31 to learn more about his research!

Oh, and there'll be free food!
