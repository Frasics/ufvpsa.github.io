While in university, you will frequently be assigned group projects. In order to succeed, you will frequently need to lead your peers. Once you enter the workplace, you will need those skills to help you and your co-workers keep your jobs.

Eleanor Li attended SFU for Communications and BioEngineering, and currently works as a project manager for Microsoft. She will speak on the subject of leadership at 2:30pm on January 16th in A353. And, as usual, there will be free food!
