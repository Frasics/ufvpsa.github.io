>D-Wave is the recognized leader in the development, fabrication, and integration of superconducting quantum computers. Our systems are being used by world-class organizations and institutions including Lockheed-Martin, Google, NASA, and USC. D-Wave has been granted over 110 US patents and has published over 80 peer-reviewed papers in leading scientific journals.

We're incredibly excited to be able to offer a tour to one of the premier physics facilities in the lower mainland! Our last tour of D-Wave occurred in 2014, and was extremely popular. We will meet in A353 before leaving for D-Wave at 2:30pm on September 30. Please contact ufvphysics@gmail.com well in advance to register; there are only a limited number of spots.
