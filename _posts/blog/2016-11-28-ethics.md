>Ethics are of utmost importance to engineers and scientists. Using information inethically can cost time, money, or even lives. Due to the importance of ethics, Engineers-in-Training must take a course on ethics and pass an ethics exam to become a professional engineer (P.Eng) in Canada.

On November 28 at 7:00pm, Claudio Arato will return to UFV to discuss innovation and ethics in engineering. He is an experienced P.Eng with a passion for ethics in engineering. Last year's event drew over 50 students and covered many interesting topics. This year's event hopes to delve deeper into ethical quandaries that may present themselves to engineers. It will be an exciting, interesting, and useful event-- and there'll be free food!
