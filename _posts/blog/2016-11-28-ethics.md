On November 28, Claudio Arato will return to UFV to discuss innovation and ethics in engineering. Last year's event drew over 50 students and covered many interesting topics. This year's event hopes to delve deeper into ethical quandaries that may present themselves to engineers. It will be an exciting, interesting, and useful event-- and there'll be free food!
