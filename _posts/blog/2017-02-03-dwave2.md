><a href="http://www.dwavesys.com/D-Wave">D-Wave Systems</a> is the recognized leader in the development, fabrication, and integration of superconducting quantum computers. Our systems are being used by world-class organizations and institutions including Lockheed-Martin, Google, NASA, and USC. D-Wave has been granted over 110 US patents and has published over 80 peer-reviewed papers in leading scientific journals.

We're incredibly excited to be able to offer a tour to one of the premier physics facilities in the lower mainland! Our last tour of D-Wave occurred in the fall of 2016, and was extremely popular. We will meet in A353 before leaving for D-Wave at 2:20pm on February 3 and leave at 2:30pm. To sign up, please fill in the form in front of A353.
