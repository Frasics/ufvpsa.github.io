Math Mania is an evening of mathematical demonstrations, puzzles and hands-on activities for elementary school children. It’s designed to show children – and their parents – how much fun you can have playing with mathematical games and concepts. 

Volunteers run individual tables, each with their own activity or activities. You’ll get a chance to try out your games before the children appear – you don’t need to be an expert, just enthusiastic! If you’re collecting volunteer hours for a practicum or for entrance into a teaching program, we can give you a letter describing your involvement.

It will be held at Sandy Hill, Abbotsford, on October 5 from 5:00 to 8:30pm

Please contact <a href="mailto:math.mania@ufv.ca">Cynthia Loten</a> by September 24 for more details.
