There is an event going on in Chilliwack on March 24th at 5 PM called the Chilliwack Hackathon. This event is specifically targeting business and hi-tech college and university students in the Fraser Valley, but is open to anyone over the age of 18 who wants to get involved. It would be a good event for the students going through the Mechatronics program to get more hands on and team building experience. All the information is posted <a href="http://chilliwack.tech/Hackathon">here </a>".
