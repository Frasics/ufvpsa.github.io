<p> The Faculty of Science is running a science outreach program. Super Science Club is an after-school program for elementary students that UFV offers in collaboration with Science World. The goal of this program is to inspire children to be inquisitive about the world around them, and to develop a long-term interest in science and technology. Science World provides paid training and UFV student facilitators use the Science World curriculum. See <a href="http://www.scienceworld.ca/ssc"> for more  information about the program.</p>

<p> Successful applicants will be running a Super Science Club program at Eugene Reimer Middle School or at Auguston Traditional Elementary School in Abbotsford. The Eugene Reimer students will come from  feeder elementary schools. A program will typically run for 4-5 weeks, one afternoon per week from about 2:30 â€“ 4:30. (The day of the week will depend on UFV student facilitator availability). </p>
 

<p> We are looking for students with a passion for science and who love working with kids! </p>
 

<p> The pay for the positions is $11.35 per hour. Please apply by sending your resume and a brief letter of interest to robin.endelman@ufv.ca by Monday, November 27, 2017 for full consideration. </p>
