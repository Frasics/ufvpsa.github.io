Throughout my years at UFV, I've spent many hours tutoring physics and mathematics. Most of the time, this requires me to drive to a student's house to assist them. While this allows a great relationship between the student and the tutor, some people can't, or don't want to do all of that travel.

Enter the Academic Success Centre. A new initiative at UFV, which is in need of competent Physics and Mathematics tutors for the new year. A quick 2 minute walk from the UFV Physics Centre, it's the perfect job for the non-car commuter, or someone who wants more of a challenge than just Physics 11 or 12.
