One of the most important roles of a scientist is outreach and advocacy. One of the other most important roles is making sure you have the money to pay for tuition and food.

An opportunity to assist Central Abbotsford Community Schools with their new Robotics and Physics after-school programs has been posted. Check out the exerpt below!

> Unless you’re a trained physicist or an engineering program graduate, chances are you don’t realize how much this important science impacts our everyday life. Does your middle school student enjoy building things or learning about cool science stuff? Always wonders why and asks about how everything works? Then our Everyday Physics Program is the perfect fit! Learn about gravity, electricity, magnets, gears and all kinds of interesting physics topics, through experiments and class discussion.
