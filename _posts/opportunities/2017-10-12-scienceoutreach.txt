The Faculty of Science is running a science outreach program at Eugene Reimer Middle School this Fall.

Super Science Club is an after-school program for elementary students that UFV offers in collaboration with Science World. The goal of this program is to inspire children to be inquisitive about the world around them, and to develop a long-term interest in science and technology. Science World provides paid training and UFV student facilitators will be using the Science World curriculum. See http://www.scienceworld.ca/ssc for more information.

Super Science Club will be running at Eugene Reimer Middle School in Abbotsford on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday afternoons from about 2:30 â€“ 4:30 beginning the end of October or early November, for about 4 weeks. (The day of the week will depend on UFV student facilitator availability). The students will be from feeder elementary schools.

We are looking for students with a passion for science and who love working with kids!

The pay for the positions is $10.85 per hour. Please apply by sending your resume and a brief letter of interest to robin.endelman@ufv.ca ASAP and not later than Friday, October 13, 2017.

Successful candidates will be required to obtain a criminal record check, and should be available for training at Science World October 20th or 21st.
